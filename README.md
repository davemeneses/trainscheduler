# trainscheduler

## Getting Started

This is scheduling web-page to help individuals manage recurring transit. An example of this would be a local train transit system such as the CTA in Chicago.

## Built With

I ended up using the following technologies to build the page in addition to standard HTML, CSS, and JS:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## How to Use

Fill out each section in the form then click submit. The built in JS and jQuery formulas will tell you when you can next expect each for of transit to arrive at the particular station you are at.

Firebase will save your data so that you will be able to reference this page in the future and not have to reenter the data.

## Collaborators

I built this myself in collaboration with my tutor from Trilogy, Alex Bowen.
